often compared to an array

linked list put the values in nodes that are linked with each other

Each node contains the address of next node 

for array we have to take the index value and the value stored can be changed
but
for linkedlist we have to go through head and continue till the Kth element
it is slower thats why
thus why???
adding and removing values at the begining of list is fast

for array address locations are physically next to each other
for that if we have to add something in array in head we have to shift all the values
that makes it slower and complicated

For double linked list
it contains the address of next and previous 
in this case adding element at end will be very easier

circular linked list:- giving address of head to tale...than it can move circularly
                        but in one direction

double circular linkedlist:- for multi direction we use double circular linked list
