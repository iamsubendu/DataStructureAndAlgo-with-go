// Hash-Table
// A Hash-Table is a data structure that maps keys to values.
//Each position of the
// Hash-Table is called a slot. The Hash-Table uses a hash
//function to calculate
// an index of a list. We use the Hash-Table when the number
//of key actually
// stored is small relatively to the number of possible keys.

// Hash-Table Abstract Data Type (ADT)
// ADT of Hash-Table contains the following functions:
// Insert(x): Add object x to the data set.
// Delete(x): Delete object x from the data set.
// Search(x): Search object x in data set.
// The Hash-Table is a useful data struct

//arrays can be larger...and finding a term can be very
//difficult so we give the term to hash function
//which gives us a hash code(index) and we can find the
//value by it.
