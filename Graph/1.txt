A graph is an abstract data type

A graph is a non-linear data structure, which consists of vertices(or nodes) 
connected by edges(or arcs) where edges may be directed or undirected. 
In Computer science graphs are used to represent the flow of computation(data values).

have edges and vertices/vertex

the node points are called vertex
and 
the joining lines or pointing lines are called edges 

when the graph has many edges we call it => dense
when the graph has less edges we call it => sparse

we can make direct or undirect graph
undirect graph => every edge is bidirectional

we can also make cyclic graph

we can also make weighted graph
=> some weights like 20, 10,3 etc on edges
=> 5 min
=> 10kg ... anything

It has restrictions
1. a child can't point towards parent
2. no cycles are allowed or if its a binary tree their should be max of 2 nodes as children

2 common ways to represent graph with the code
1> Adjacency List => graph is represented as list of vertices and each vertex
                     holds the neighbouring vertices
                     it gonna look like list of lists
                     This list can be anything as linked list, array,dynamic array ...

                     we will call the vertex as key...as each key will have some of its unique information

2> Adjacency Matrix => we can show it with 2d array
                        also we can show it for list tooo

                        edges are bidirectional here



adjacency list are comparibly good than adjacency Matrix

                    Adjacency Matrix    Adjacency List
Edge LookUp                 O(1)                O(V)
Add vertex                  O(V^2)              O(1)
Remove vertex               O(V^2)              O(E)
Add Edge                    O(1)                O(1)    
Remove Edge                 O(1)                O(V)



Application of Graphs:

Computer Science: In computer science, graph is used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices etc.
Physics and Chemistry: Graph theory is also used to study molecules in chemistry and physics.
Social Science: Graph theory is also widely used in sociology.
Mathematics: In this, graphs are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology such as knot theory.
Biology: Graph theory is useful in biology and conservation efforts.
