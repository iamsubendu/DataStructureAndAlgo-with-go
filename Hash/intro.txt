//Hash Tables

array + doubly linked list

A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. 
It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.

for a name stored in an array..it will take out long to find out at what index it is stored

thus..their is hash function 

which will spit out the index no as the word is inserted in it

storedfor inserting a value
we will use hash function to store the value
and the hash function will store at the right index
and when we will search for the required value
it will give us the index


each letter of word converted into its ascii convertedthan its sum up 
than divided by the size of array
and the no we will get will be its index value


sometimes their might be a chance that 2 names have same hash code.
so for handling it 
=> collision handling is their
        =>1. open addressing - if the index is already occupied the next value is stored in the next index value
                                and when it come for search we will go to where the hash func says us to go
                                than if not found than we will go to next position from it....
                                this is faster
                                but as the names get more and more for the same index or same hash code, name will 
                                be stored further and further from the real hash code

        thus 

        =>2. seperate chaining - storing multiple name in one slot by using property of linked list
