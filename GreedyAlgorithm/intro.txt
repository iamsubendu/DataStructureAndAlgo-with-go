A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is
used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice
at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve
the entire problem.

Intuitive means having the ability to understand or know
something without any direct evidence or reasoning process.

A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice
that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes
a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead
to a globally-optimal solution.
