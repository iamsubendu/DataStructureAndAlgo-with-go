// Priority Queue (Heap)
// In a heap, the
// records are stored in an array. Each node in the heap follows the same rule
// that
// the parent value is greater than its children are.
// There are two types of the heap data structure:
// 1. Max heap: each node should be greater than or equal to each of its
// children.
// 2. Min heap: each node should be smaller than or equal to each of its
// children.

// Heap ADT Operations· Insert() - Adding a new element to the heap.
// The Time Complexity of
// this operation is O(log(n))
// · remove() - Extracting max for max heap case (or min for min heap
// case). The Time Complexity of this operation is O(log(n))
// · Heapify() – To convert a list of numbers in a list into a heap.
// This
// operation has a Time Complexity O(n)
