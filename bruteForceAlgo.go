//Brute Force Algorithms are exactly what they sound like â€“
//straightforward methods of solving a problem that rely on
//sheer computing power and trying every possibility rather
//than advanced techniques to improve efficiency.

//For example, imagine you have a small padlock with 4 digits,
//each from 0-9. You forgot your combination, but you don't
//want to buy another padlock. Since you can't remember any
//of the digits, you have to use a brute force method to open the lock.

//So you set all the numbers back to 0 and try them one by
//one: 0001, 0002, 0003, and so on until it opens.
//In the worst case scenario, it would take 104, or
//10,000 tries to find your combination.

//to check out an element in an array
